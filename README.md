# Long Distance Tracking Mod // (**Minecraft 1.8.9**)
### Mod that allows the player to change the render distance value for entities, allowing them to be viewed from farther away.
### [WARNING] DO NOT use this mod in regular vanilla, or even servers with a lot of entities, because this can cause a lot of lag for your client.
